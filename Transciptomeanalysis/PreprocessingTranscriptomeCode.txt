# Download the transcriptome data set and reference genome files (as .fna, .fasta, and .gff) from the link on Canvas. The transcriptome data set is 8 total samples, 2 replicates of planktonically grown P. aeruginosa and 2 replicates of biofilm P. aeruginosa each with a forward (pass 1) and reverse (pass 2) read. The .fna, .fasta, and .gff files should be directly in your folder for transcriptome work. The reads will be in a folder called fastq in your transcriptome folder.

# What is this code doing?
gunzip fastq/*.gz

# Prepare the genome file
hisat2-build <path to genome file FNA> paeru

# Align reads to genome and assemble the transcripts #you will need to do these commands for every pair of reads (there are 4 in the tutorial). As an example, this is the command I ran for the plank01 sample.

hisat2 -q -x paeru -1 fastq/plank01_F.fastq -2 fastq/plank01_R.fastq -S plank01.sam

# Convert the .sam file to a .bam file. As an example, this is the command I ran for the plank01sample. This .sam file is also large, so you can delete it once youâ€™ve created the .bam file.

samtools view -bS plank01.sam > plank01.bam

# Convert the .bam to a sorted .bam. This compresses the file and sorts the variants for easier discovery. As an example, this is the command I ran for the plank01 sample. 

samtools sort plank01.bam -o plank01.sorted.bam

# Reconstruct transcripts for each sample. As an example, this is the command I ran for the plank01 sample. 

stringtie plank01.sorted.bam -G paeruginosa.gff -o stringtie/plank01.transcripts.gtf

# Create a file with the names of the files. As an example, this is the command I ran for the plank01 sample, followed by the plank02 sample.  Remember, file 1 gets >. Files 2-4 >>

echo stringtie/plank01.transcripts.gtf > assemblies.txt

echo stringtie/plank02.transcripts.gtf >> assemblies.txt

# Verify that assemblies.txt contains all file names #remember the command that lets you view the first contents of a file

# Merge the transcripts
stringtie --merge -G paeruginosa.gff -o stringtie_merged.gtf assemblies.txt

# Count the number of lines in the merged file
cat stringtie_merged.gtf | grep -v "^#" | awk '$3=="transcript" {print}' | wc -l

# Compare assembled transcripts to known transcripts
gffcompare -r paeruginosa.gff -G -o merged stringtie_merged.gtf

# View success of comparison
  cat merged.stats

# Estimate abundance and create Ballgown folder (for use in visualization). You will need to do this for each file. Here is the specific command I used for the plank01 file

stringtie -e -B -p 8 -G stringtie_merged.gtf -o ballgown/plank01/plank01.gtf plank01.sorted.bam
stringtie -e -B -p 8 -G stringtie_merged.gtf -o ballgown/plank02/plank02.gtf plank02.sorted.bam
