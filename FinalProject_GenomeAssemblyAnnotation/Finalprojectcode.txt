Presentation notes to present
*What is my bacteria 
*Why I chose this


N50
UNITIG
SCAFFOLD
CONTIG
how complete my genome is according to BUSCO output form abyss
compare abyss to spades with QUAST
show graghs







Downloaded Zipped files from Dr. Van Laar. 
	File name FinalProject_GenomeAssemblyAnnotation

#Unzipping the file
$gunzip /Charles.zip/*.gz (DOESNT WORK)


#genome assembly using abyss
	Installing abyss 
$mamba install -c bioconda -c conda-forge abyss


#Assemblying Sequnces
$abyss-pe name=finalprojectSalinibacter k=96 B=2G in='reads1.fastq.gz reads2.fastq.gz'

#After Abyss finishes
	Upload data to galaxy
	once data is uplaoded... 

1. Run Spades on Galaxy
	to run select:
	1. pair end reads: individual data set
	2. select reads 1 and reads 2 from downloaded data set that I uploaded
	3. leave default and 
	**run tool**
	After SPAdes finshes
	1.Download assembly graph
	2.Assembly graph with Scaffolds
	3.Contigs
	4.scaffolds
	**Move everything from SPAdes into new folder. 

#Quality Control on Galaxy
	to run Quast select:
	1.individual assembly
	2.select scaffolds--should allow to select it because its in there from previous run
	3.type of assembly: genome assembly
	4.Use reference genome
	*NEED to find one
		go to NCBI
		*type species name in search bar and hit search.
			1.must select one with the star.
				a.download reference genome
					1.genome sequence fasta
					2.GFF file
					*name it reference species name
